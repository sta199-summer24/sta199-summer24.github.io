## Project grading

-   Outlined at <https://sta199-summer24.github.io/project/>.

-   Each milestone has points associated with it.

-   Additionally there are points allocated to reproducibility and organization as well as teamwork (to be measured by within team peer evaluations three times throughout the semester).

-   Most important thing you can do today for your project: Block off agreed times in your calendar!

# Reading data into R

## Reading rectangular data

-   Using [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/):
    -   Most commonly: `read_csv()`
    -   Maybe also: `read_tsv()`, `read_delim()`, etc.
-   Using [**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/): `read_excel()`
-   Using [**googlesheets4**](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/): `read_sheet()` -- We haven't covered this in the videos, but might be useful for your projects
