## While you wait for class to begin...

::: nonincremental
-   Open your `lab-4` project, save and commit any pending changes, and push them to GitHub
-   Any questions from prepare materials?

## Announcements

-   Fill out TEAMMATES survey to provide feedback to your teammates (and to let us know how things are going)
-   Fill out the (optional) midterm course evaluation
-   A note on AE scores -- they will continue to be updated!
-   Yet another survey: The Campus Culture Survey ‚Äì UG participation is very low, help lift it up!

## Lab 4 update

**Pull** changes, see that Question 1 in `lab-4.qmd` is updated with the following code chunk:

```{{r}}
#| file: lab-4-clubs-scrape.R
#| eval: false
```

Render `lab-4.qmd` and commit and push your changes.

# From last time -- Application exercise

## Goal

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Scrape data and organize it in a tidy format in R
-   Perform light text parsing to clean data
-   Summarize and visualize the data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/chronicle-data.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## `ae-09`

::: appex
-   Go to the project navigator in RStudio (top right corner of your RStudio window) and open the project called ae.
-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and then click Pull.
-   Open the file called `chronicle-scrape.R` and follow along.
:::

## Recap

-   Use the SelectorGadget identify tags for elements you want to grab
-   Use rvest to first read the whole page (into R) and then parse the object you've read in to the elements you're interested in
-   Put the components together in a data frame (a tibble) and analyze it like you analyze any other data

## A new R workflow {.smaller}

-   When working in a Quarto document, your analysis is re-run each time you knit

-   If web scraping in a Quarto document, you'd be re-scraping the data each time you knit, which is undesirable (and not *nice*)!

-   An alternative workflow:

    -   Use an R script to save your code
    -   Saving interim data scraped using the code in the script as CSV or RDS files
    -   Use the saved data in your analysis in your Quarto document

# Web scraping considerations

## Ethics: "Can you?" vs "Should you?"

## Challenges: Data broken into many pages

![](images/many-pages.png){fig-align="center"}

## Workflow: Screen scraping vs. APIs

Two different scenarios for web scraping:

-   Screen scraping: extract data from source code of website, with html parser (easy) or regular expression matching (less easy)

-   Web APIs (application programming interface): website offers a set of structured http requests that return JSON or XML files

## Workflow: Scraping from many pages {.smaller}

-   So far you've learned to scrape data from a single page

-   If you wanted to scrape data from multiple, similarly structured web pages (e.g., scrape the text and other metadata for each opinion article on The Chronicle):

    -   Write the code to scrape one page

    -   Turn it into a function that takes the webpage URL as an argument and returns the scraped, structured data

    -   Map the function over the list of URLs of interest

# The üêò in the room: Chat GPT

## Using Chat GPT

::: question
How are you using Chat GPT for this class?
:::

## Example 1 - From Lab 4 {.smaller}

::: question
Another variable that needs some cleaning up is `membership_status`.
Currently it should either be `NA` or contain some text that says `"Select ... to register for this group"`.
Recode this variable to say `"Closed"` if the current value is `NA` or `"Open"` otherwise.
Save the resulting dataset with these two new variables as `clubs`, i.e., overwrite the data frame.

Then, display the first 10 rows of the dataset, `relocate()`ing `membership_status` to the beginning of the dataset to make sure it appears in the output in your rendered document.
:::

## Sample data {.xsmall}

```{r}
#| output-location: slide

df <- tribble(
  ~club, ~membership_status,
  1, "Select AI Competition Club's group. Select the group and click on the Join button at the bottom of the page to register for this group",
  2, NA,
  3, "Select Black Pre-Law Society at Duke's group. Select the group and click on the Join button at the bottom of the page to register for this group",
  4, NA,
  5, NA,
  6, "Select Duke Women's Flag Football Team's group. Select the group and click on the Join button at the bottom of the page to register for this group",
  7, NA,
  8, NA,
  9, NA,
  10, "Select Latino Medical Student Association's group. Select the group and click on the Join button at the bottom of the page to register for this group",
  11, NA,
  12, "Select Native American/Indigenous Student Alliance's group. Select the group and click on the Join button at the bottom of the page to register for this group",

## Example 2 {.smaller}

::: question
Each CSI franchise includes a number of series, each with the character string `"CSI"` (in capital letters) in their title.
Using this information, create a new data frame called `csi` that only has titles from the CSI-verse and all of the columns from `tv` for these titles.
Then, display the first 10 rows of `csi`.
**Note:** The titles and seasons included in the dataset may not be all CSI titles and titles that have ever aired.

## Guidelines and best practices for using Chat GPT {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Do [**not**]{.underline} just copy-paste the prompt ‚Äì for appropriate academic conduct, for your own learning, and for getting to better results faster
-   Engineer the prompt until the response starts to look like code you're learning in the course
-   If the response is not correct, ask for a correction
-   If the response doesn't follow the guidelines, ask for a correction
-   Do not just copy-paste code from Chat GPT responses, run it line-by-line and edit as needed
-   Watch out for clear mistakes in the response: do not keep loading packages that are already loaded, use the base pipe `|>`, use tidyverse-based code, etc.
