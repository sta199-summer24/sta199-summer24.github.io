# Linear regression with a multiple predictors

## Goals {.smaller}

-   Recap modeling with a single predictor

-   Fit and interpret models with multiple predictors

-   Distinguish between additive and interaction models

## Application exercise: `ae-12-modeling-penguins-multi` {.smaller}

-   Go back to your project called `ae`.
-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and push.
-   Work on `ae-12-modeling-penguins-multi.qmd`.
