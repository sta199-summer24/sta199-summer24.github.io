## Announcements {.smaller}

-   No Thursday office hours
-   Teammate evaluation 1 for your group project is due tonight by 11:59 PM. It is under the **Quiz** tab on Canvas. There will be time allotted at the end of class. This will be used, along with other factors, to determine your **Teamwork** score for the project.
-   A second teammate evaluation is due by 6/25 at 11:59 PM.

## Take-home exam 2 tips

-   Make sure your take-home exam can render! 
-   To be extra cautious: render every time after starting a new code chunk!
-   If you aren't sure how to complete a problem, break it into sub-steps that you do know how to complete.
-   Reference the AEs! Solutions are on the course website next to the green check marks.

## Project Write-up Tips {.smaller}

The final report should be nicely formatted as a formal summary of your data analysis. 


- Any math notation should be properly formatted in mathmode.
- Only include figures that are pertinent to your analysis.
-   Do not include the URL for the data in the report. This should go in a formal `References` section.
-   Do not `glimpse()` the data in the final report.
-   No code should be printed to screen, but the project should be reproducible! For example, set seeds if you use randomization.
-   Please read all documentation on the course website regarding the project. It is all contained under the `Project` tab.
-   

## Options you MUST add to the YAML of project.qmd  {.smaller}

- To suppress warnings, to suppress the code, and to render your document to pdf:

## Project {.smaller}

-   After Thursday, review peer evaluations left by your peers, implement updates as you see fit, close the issue once you review them.

-   Have a clear plan for who is doing what, open issues on your repo, and assign them to individuals who can then close the issues as they finish a task.

-   Schedule at least one team meeting between today and your presentation to practice your presentation together.

# Application exercise

## Application exercise: `ae-17-effective-dataviz` {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your project called `ae`.
-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and push. Then pull.
-   Work on `ae-17-effective-dataviz.qmd`.
:::

## Recap {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole
-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible
-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable
-   Prefer direct labeling over legends
-   Use accessible colors
-   Use color to draw attention
-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose
-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels
-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off")
:::

## Reminders {.smaller}

- Finish AE 16, exercise 12 and 13.
- Finish AE 18.
- Don't forget to push AEs 16-18 to github.
- Complete Teammate Evaluation 1 before 11:59 PM tonight.
