## Announcements {.smaller}

-   No Thursday office hours
-   Teammate evaluation for your group project is due tonight by 11:59 PM. It is under the **Quiz** tab on Canvas. There will be time allotted at the end of class. This will be used, along with other factors, to determine your **Teamwork** score for the project.


## Take-home exam 2 tips

-   Make sure your take-home exam can render! 
-   To be extra cautious: render after after starting a new code chunk! Do this every time!
-   If you aren't sure how to complete a problem, break it into sub-steps that you do know how to complete.
-   Reference your AEs!


## Project {.smaller}

-   Review peer evaluations left by your peers, implement updates as you see fit, close the issue once you review them.

-   Have a clear plan for who is doing what, open issues on your repo, and assign them to individuals who can then close the issues as they finish a task.

-   Schedule at least one team meting between today and your presentation to practice your presentation together.

## Recap {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole
-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible
-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable
-   Prefer direct labeling over legends
-   Use accessible colors
-   Use color to draw attention
-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose
-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels
-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off")
