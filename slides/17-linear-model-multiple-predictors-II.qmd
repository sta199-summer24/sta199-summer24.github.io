## Lab 4 recap- interpreting log() response {.smaller}

Goal: Interpret the coefficients based on the following regression:

$$
\log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 +\cdots.
$$
We don't want our interpretation based on the $\log()$ scale:

$$
e^{\log(Y)} = Y = e^{ \beta_0} e^{ \beta_1 x_1}e^{ \beta_2 x_2 }e^{ \cdots}.
$$
So, say we want to interpret $\beta_2$ where $x_2$ is a categorical group membership variable:
$$
Y = e^{ \beta_0} e^{ \beta_1 x_1}\color{red}{e^{ \beta_2 \times 1 }}e^{ \cdots}.
$$

# Model selection and overfitting

## Goals

-   Review prediction and interpretation of model results
-   Review main and interaction effects models
-   Discuss model selection further

## Application exercise: `ae-13-modeling-loans` {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your project called `ae`.
-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and push.
-   Work on `ae-13-modeling-loans.qmd`.
