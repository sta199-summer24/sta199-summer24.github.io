# From last time

## Application exercise: `ae-12-modeling-penguins-multi` {.smaller}

::: appex
Continue work on `ae-12-modeling-penguins-multi.qmd`.
:::

**Goals:**

-   Recap modeling with a single predictor
-   Fit and interpret models with multiple predictors
-   Distinguish between additive and interaction models

# Model selection and overfitting

## Goals

-   Review prediction and interpretation of model results
-   Review main and interaction effects models
-   Discuss model selection further

## Application exercise: `ae-13-modeling-loans` {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your project called `ae`.
-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and push.
-   Work on `ae-13-modeling-loans.qmd`.
