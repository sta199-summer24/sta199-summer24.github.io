## Leisure, commute, physical activity and BP {.smaller .scrollable}

**Background:** Whether all domains of daily‐life moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are associated with lower blood pressure (BP) and how this association depends on age and body mass index remains unclear.

**Methods and Results:** In the population‐based Lifelines cohort (N=125,402), MVPA was assessed by the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health‐Enhancing Physical Activity, a validated questionnaire in different domains such as commuting, leisure‐time, and occupational PA.
BP was assessed using the last 3 of 10 measurements after 10 minutes’ rest in the supine position.
Hypertension was defined as systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensives.
In regression analysis, higher commuting and leisure‐time but not occupational MVPA related to lower BP and lower hypertension risk.
Commuting‐and‐leisure‐time MVPA was associated with BP in a dose‐dependent manner.
β Coefficients (95% CI) from linear regression analyses were −1.64 (−2.03 to −1.24), −2.29 (−2.68 to −1.90), and finally −2.90 (−3.29 to −2.50) mm Hg systolic BP for the low, middle, and highest tertile of MVPA compared with “No MVPA” as the reference group after adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking and alcohol use.
Further adjustment for body mass index attenuated the associations by 30% to 50%, but more MVPA remained significantly associated with lower BP and lower risk of hypertension.
This association was age dependent.
β Coefficients (95% CI) for the highest tertiles of commuting‐and‐leisure‐time MVPA were −1.67 (−2.20 to −1.15), −3.39 (−3.94 to −2.82) and −4.64 (−6.15 to −3.14) mm Hg systolic BP in adults \<40, 40 to 60, and \>60 years, respectively.

**Conclusions:** Higher commuting and leisure‐time but not occupational MVPA were significantly associated with lower BP and lower hypertension risk at all ages, but these associations were stronger in older adults.

## Modelling

-   Use models to explain the relationship between variables and to make predictions
-   For now we will focus on **linear** models (but there are *many* *many* other types of models too!)

## Modelling vocabulary

-   Predictor (explanatory variable)
-   Outcome (response variable)
-   Regression line
    -   Slope
    -   Intercept
-   Correlation

-   Ranges between -1 and 1.
-   Same sign as the slope.
