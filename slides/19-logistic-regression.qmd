## Basic guidelines {.smaller}

> Be a Good Human

::: incremental
-   Use electronic devices for things related to coursework only and in a way that does not distract your classmates

    -   No videos on cell phones

    -   No phone calls!

-   Take off your headphones

    -   If you need an accommodation for wearing headphones in class, reach out to SDAO to get this offcially approved

-   Keep chatter to "your turn" portions or limited to clarification questions

-   If you have a guest in class, make sure they are aware of the DCS and take responsibility for their behaviour

## Announcements {.smaller}

-   Peer eval 2 is due Sunday night, results will be published on Monday

-   Lab 6 is due on Monday:

    -   **Render your document.** If your code is running off the page so we can't see your entire code, we will not evaluate any of it.
        The question will automatically receive a 0.
        This is something you can and should verify before you turn in your work.

    -   If you're using functions that are not introduced in the course materials, you **must cite your sources**.
        Failure to do so is a violation of the Duke Community Standard and will be treated as such.

-   Lab 7 will cover material from this week and next week.
    Start to working through prepare materials between now and Monday.

# From last time

## Recap: `ae-13-modeling-loans`

-   What is the practical difference between a model with parallel and non-parallel lines?

-   What is the definition of R-squared?

-   Why do we choose models based on adjusted R-squared and not R-squared?

## Predict interest rate...

from credit utilization and homeownership

```{r}
#| include: false
loans <- loans_full_schema |>
  mutate(
    credit_util = total_credit_utilized / total_credit_limit,
    bankruptcy = as.factor(if_else(public_record_bankrupt == 0, 0, 1)),
    verified_income = droplevels(verified_income),
    homeownership = str_to_title(homeownership),
    homeownership = fct_relevel(homeownership, "Rent", "Mortgage", "Own")
  ) |>
  rename(credit_checks = inquiries_last_12m) |>
  select(
    interest_rate, loan_amount, verified_income, 
    debt_to_income, credit_util, bankruptcy, term, 
    credit_checks, issue_month, homeownership
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: rate-util-home-fit
rate_util_home_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(interest_rate ~ credit_util + homeownership, data = loans)
```

```{r}
#| label: rate-util-home-tidy

tidy(rate_util_home_fit)
```

## Intercept {.smaller}

```{r}
#| ref.label: rate-util-home-tidy
#| echo: false
```

-   Intercept: Loan applicants who rent and have 0 credit utilization are predicted to receive an interest rate of 9.93%, on average.

## Slopes {.smaller}

```{r}
#| ref.label: rate-util-home-tidy
#| echo: false
```

::: incremental
-   All else held constant, for each additional percent credit utilization is higher, interest rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by 0.0534%.

-   All else held constant, the model predicts that loan applicants who have a mortgage for their home receive 0.696% higher interest rate than those who rent their home, on average.

-   All else held constant, the model predicts that loan applicants who own their home receive 0.128% higher interest rate than those who rent their home, on average.

# Transformations

## Predict log(interest rate)

```{r}
#| label: rate-log-cc-fit
rate_log_cc_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(log(interest_rate) ~ credit_checks, data = loans)

tidy(rate_log_cc_fit)
```

## Model

```{r}
#| ref.label: rate-log-cc-fit
#| echo: false
```

. . .

$$
\widehat{log(interest~rate)} = 2.39 + 0.0236 \times credit~checks
$$

## Slope

```{r}
#| ref.label: rate-log-cc-fit
#| echo: false
```

. . .

For each additional credit check, log of interest rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by 0.0236%.

## Slope {.smaller}

$$
log(interest~rate_{x+1}) - log(interest~rate_{x}) =  0.0236
$$

. . .

$$
log(\frac{interest~rate_{x+1}}{interest~rate_{x}}) = 0.0236
$$

. . .

$$
e^{log(\frac{interest~rate_{x+1}}{interest~rate_{x}})} = e^{0.0236}
$$

. . .

$$
\frac{interest~rate_{x+1}}{interest~rate_{x}} = 1.024
$$

. . .

For each additional credit check, interest rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by **a factor of 1.024**.

# Logistic regression

## What is logistic regression?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Similar to linear regression....
    but

-   Modeling tool when our response is categorical

## Modelling binary outcomes

-   Variables with binary outcomes follow the **Bernouilli distribution**:

    -   $y_i \sim Bern(p)$

    -   $p$: Probability of success

    -   $1-p$: Probability of failure

-   We can't model $y$ directly, so instead we model $p$

## Linear model

$$
p_i = \beta_o + \beta_1 \times X_1 + \cdots + \epsilon
$$

-   But remember that $p$ must be between 0 and 1

-   We need a **link function** that transforms the linear model to have an appropriate range

## Logit link function

The **logit** function take values between 0 and 1 (probabilities) and maps them to values in the range negative infinity to positive infinity:

$$
logit(p) = log \bigg( \frac{p}{1 - p} \bigg)
$$

```{r}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)

tibble(
  x = seq(0.001, 0.999, 0.001),
  y = log(x / (1-x))
) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1), breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)) +
  labs(x = "p", y = "logit(p)", title = "logit(p) vs. p")
```

## This isn't exactly what we need though.....

-   Recall, the goal is to take values between -$\infty$ and $\infty$ and map them to probabilities.

-   We need the opposite of the link function...
    or the *inverse*

-   Taking the inverse of the logit function will map arbitrary real values back to the range \[0, 1\]

## Generalized linear model

-   We model the logit (log-odds) of $p$ :

$$
logit(p) = log \bigg( \frac{p}{1 - p} \bigg) = \beta_o + \beta_1 \times X1_i + \cdots + \epsilon 
$$

-   Then take the inverse to obtain the predicted $p$:

$$
p_i = \frac{e^{\beta_o + \beta_1 \times X1_i + \cdots + \epsilon}}{1 + e^{\beta_o + \beta_1 \times X1_i + \cdots + \epsilon}}
$$

## A logistic model visualized

```{r}
#| echo: false

sigmoid = function(x) 1 / (1 + exp(-x + 10))
plot.function(sigmoid, from = 0, to = 20, n = 101, 
              ylab="P(Y = 1)", 
              xlab = "X (predictor)", 
              main = "Predicted probability Y = 1", 
              lwd = 3)
```

## Takeaways

-   Generalized linear models allow us to fit models to predict non-continuous outcomes

-   Predicting binary outcomes requires modeling the log-odds of success, where p = probability of success
