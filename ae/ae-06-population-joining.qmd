title: "AE 06: Joining country populations with continents"
---

## Goal

Our ultimate goal in this application exercise is to create a bar plot of total populations of continents, where the input data are:

1.  Countries and populations
2.  Countries and continents

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and visualization
library(scales)    # for pretty axis breaks
```

## Data

### Countries and populations

These data come from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) and reflect population counts as of 2022.

```{r}
#| label: load-population-data
#| message: false

population <- read_csv("https://sta199-s24.github.io/data/world-pop-2022.csv")
```

Let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: view-population-data

population
```

### Continents

These data come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/continents-according-to-our-world-in-data).

```{r}
#| label: load-continents-data
#| message: false

continents <- read_csv("https://sta199-s24.github.io/data/continents.csv")
```

Let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: view-continents-data

continents
```

## Exercises

-   **Think out loud:**

    -   Which variable(s) will we use to join the `population` and `continents` data frames?

    Add response here.

    -   We want to create a new data frame that keeps all rows and columns from `population` and brings in the corresponding information from `continents`. Which join function should we use?

    Add response here.

-   **Demo:** Join the two data frames and name assign the joined data frame to a new data frame `population_continents`.

```{r}
#| label: join-population-continents

# add code here
```

-   **Demo:** Take a look at the newly created `population_continent` data frame. There are some countries that were not in `continents`. First, identify which countries these are (they will have `NA` values for `continent`).

```{r}
#| label: data-inspect

# add code here
```

-   **Demo:** All of these countries are actually in the `continents` data frame, but under different names. So, let's clean that data first by updating the country names in the `population` data frame in a way they will match the `continents` data frame, and then joining them, using a `case_when()` statement in `mutate()`. At the end, check that all countries now have continent information.

```{r}
#| label: data-clean

# add code here
```

-   **Think out loud:** Which continent do you think has the highest population? Which do you think has the second highest? The lowest?

Add your response here.

-   **Demo:** Create a new data frame called `population_summary` that contains a row for each continent and a column for the total population for that continent, in descending order of population. Note that the function for calculating totals in R is `sum()`.

```{r}
#| label: population-continents-sum

# add code here
```

-   **Your turn:** Make a bar plot with total population on the y-axis and continent on the x-axis, where the height of each bar represents the total population in that continent.

```{r}
#| label: population-summary-bar

# add code here
```

-   **Your turn:** Recreate the following plot, which is commonly referred to as a **lollipop plot**. Hint: Start with the points, then try adding the `segment`s, then add axis labels and `caption`, and finally, as a stretch goal, update the x scale (which will require a function we haven't introduced in lectures or labs yet!).

```{r}
#| label: population-summary-lollipop
#| fig-asp: 0.4

# add code here
```

-   **Think out loud:** What additional improvements would you like to make to this plot.

Add your response here.
